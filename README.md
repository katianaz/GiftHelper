# GiftHelper Project DataScience
## TechLabs - Curitiba

> In the Data Science track we could learn basic coding skills in Python and apply them directly to Data Science tasks — from data import to data preparation and visualization to building advanced machine learning models for classification and Web Development.


Data Science project developed for Techlabs. In this project it was possible to learn the python programming language, as well as use its libraries, such as pandas.
An application was developed, in which, by solving a questionnaire about a person, it is possible to receive as an answer what would be the ideal gift for that person, within a list of gifts in the application itself.
